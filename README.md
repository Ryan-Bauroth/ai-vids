## Description

# Purpose
This code helped run an instagram page as a experiment to see if you could completely automate video production, from video concept to posting. 

# Results
From this project, I learned how current LLM struggle to be creative and thus struggle to brainstorm unique video ideas. Even within the niche of videos in which users picked one of 5-6 images, the ai struggled to come up with creative image prompts for the generative ai I used.

As for the numbers, with 170 posts the account has gained 186 followers and nearly reached 200k accounts. (as of the latest update to the readme)
