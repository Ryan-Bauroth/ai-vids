## Description

### Purpose
This code helped run an instagram page as a experiment to see if you could completely automate video production

### Results
From this project, I learned how **current LLM struggle to be creative** and thus struggle to brainstorm unique video ideas. This shows that while AI may be a powerful tool, it certainly isn't replacing humans in its current state.

As for the numbers, with 170 posts the account has gained **186 followers** and nearly reached **200k accounts**. (as of the latest update to the readme)
