## Description

This code helped run an instagram page as a experiment to see if you could completely automate video production, from video concept to posting. From this project, I learned how current LLM struggle to be creative and thus struggle to brainstorm unique video ideas. Even within the niche of videos in which users picked one of 5-6 images, the ai struggled to come up with creative image prompts for the generative ai I used.
